# Create code snippets

* Have XCode open with an open source code file. Have the right pane open and showing the code snippet library.

Now go back to your editor pane and start typing what will soon be a code snippet - and remember to insert placeholders for values you have to fill out when invoking the snippet (e.g. <#token#>). Then highlight and drag that code to the library pane. Besides from naming it, you should also define a "Completion Shortcut": when you type these letters later, Xcode will offer to substitute them with your custom snippet.
