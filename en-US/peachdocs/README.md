[Peachdocs](https://peachdocs.org/) is an open source project used for wiki/documentation purposes. It takes a git repo of markdown files and displays it in a very nice HTML format.

This makes it very nice for capturing knowledge, writing documentation in markdown and simply pushing it up to a git server to update your documentation.

Features I love:

* Write your documentation in markdown.
* Website updates itself automatically by pushing to a remote git server or reading from a local git repo on the server.
* Password protect website if you wish.
* Full text search.
* Disqus integration, Google Analytics, (3rd party scripts) integration.
* Open source.
